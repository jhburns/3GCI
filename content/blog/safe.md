## **Not Just Cyber Security, But Physical Security**
Part of being a Cyber Smart Panther is keeping an eye on your stuff. The EASIEST way to hack into your accounts is to lose your computer or phone to a criminal. So, keep your laptop and smartphone in a safe place. You’ll save a lot of money not having to buy a new one and eliminate a lot of hassle if your accounts get hacked.

## **How to Lock Down Your Stuff**
First, use a passcode or lock screen on every computer and smartphone.  This one simple security measure will make all the difference if you lost it.  Second, use device encryption.  Encryption makes the data on your device not usable to criminals.  While it makes your device take a little longer to boot up, it secures your data in case of loss.  Third, use anti-virus software with “remote wipe” capabilities.  Whether Find My Phone, Lookout, or some other popular app, this software lets you not only find your device if lost, but can also let you wipe the device of all data and information.  In other words, you can get rid of all your sensitive information in case it is lost.
