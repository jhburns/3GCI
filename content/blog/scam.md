Every Cyber Smart Panther needs to be able to Spot a Scam!  Phishing emails are an easy way for cyber criminals to get access to your computer or online accounts.  Be wary of emails from suspicious senders, that use generic salutations, or try to create a sense of urgency.  And never, ever send passwords, social security, or credit card numbers over email. When shopping online, use respectable websites, like Amazon, and look for the lock that shows a it’s secure website. Don’t give hackers access to your data or accounts. A Cyber Smart Panther can Spot a Scam.

> “The chances of you being hacked far exceeds the chances of your home being burglarized. This is a big business.”
