A Cyber Smart Panther keeps their Social Media Game Tight.  Add your cell phone number to all social media accounts for two-factor authentication.  A cyber criminal would need to steal your password and take your phone to hack your account.  Hackers often use social media posts to send phishing emails, so consider keeping your account private. And remember, nothing on the Internet is 100% secure, so be careful what images you send, even to friends.
